Writing them has the following benefits:\n\n-   Reduces bugs when developing new features or when changing the existing functionality\n-   Prevents unexpected output\n-   Helps detecting edge cases\n-   Tests can serve as documentation\n\n### When should you start writing tests?\n\n-   The more certainty you want to have that your code works as intended, the more you want to invest in testing.\n\n-   Especially when code is used in production, writing tests can be very valuable and ultimately time-saving.\n\n### **When it shouldn't be usefull?**\n\n-   When you are exploring a dataset for the first time, you will be less inclined to write them.\n\n## Python Unit testing\n\n**Pytest** is a great tool for writing unit tests in Python. It makes writing tests short, easy to read, and provides great output. You can install pytest using `pip install pytest` and create a folder structure like the following:\n\nproject/\\\n├─ src/\\\n│ ├─ regex.py\\\n│ ├─ **init**.py\\\n├─ test/\\\n│ ├─ test_regex.py\\\n│ ├─ **init**.py\n\n### Use case\n\n```{r}\n\nlibrary(reticulate)\n\nSys.setenv(RETICULATE_PYTHON = \"/Users/lrabalski1/miniforge3/envs/everyday_use/bin/python\")\n\nmyenvs=conda_list()\nenvname=myenvs$name[3]\nuse_condaenv(envname, required = TRUE)\n```\n\n```{python}\nimport sys  \nsys.path.insert(0, '/Users/lrabalski1/Desktop/prv/blog/content/post/2022-11-11-unit-tests')\n```\n\nIn src/regex.py I insert following python code:\n\n```{python}\nfrom src.regex import extract_money \n\nhelp(extract_money)\n```\n\nWhile `test/test_regex.py` I hold following code.\n\n```{r}\nlibrary(readr)\ncat(readr::read_file('test/test_regex.py'))\n```\n\nIf the code is localised in the file with suffix \"test\\_\" and within folder \"test\\_\" then running code bellow from `root directory` will run test unit test.\n\n```{bash, include=TRUE}\npytest -v\n```\n\nAs you can see\n\n-   first test went positive, function work well with empty string\n\n-   second test failed, we got an AssertionError, stating that 9 is not equal to 5.49. It seems that our function only extracted the last digit of 5.49. Without this test, we would have been less likely to catch this error. The function would have returned the value 9, instead of throwing us an error.\n\n## Advantages of using Unit Test\n\nThe next step is to fix our code and make sure that it now passes the test that failed before, while still passing the first test that we wrote as well. A great thing about unit testing is that it gives you an overview of how your changes affect the project as a whole. The tests will make you aware if any of your code additions cause any unexpected consequences.\n\nFurthermore, the fact that our initial function did not pass the decimal number test raises the question what other examples might come up that we did not anticipate. Maybe we will get a number separated by a comma, like 5,49 euro. Or the monetary value is formatted as € 5.49,-. Unit testing allows us to quickly check for these cases and some other less-common \\*\\*edge cases\\*\\*.\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":"auto","echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"knitr"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":true,"code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":true,"code-tools":true,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["../../styles.css"],"highlight-style":"github","toc":true,"output-file":"index.html"},"language":{"code-summary":"Show the code"},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.2.269","editor":"source","theme":"darkly","title-block-banner":true,"code-copy":true,"code-block-border-left":"#31BAE9","title":"Unit Tests","author":"Łukasz Rąbalski","categories":["Unit testing"],"tags":["Python","Unit testing"]},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
